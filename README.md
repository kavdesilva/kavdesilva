### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am a software engineer with ten years of experience working with people in a multitude of client-facing positions. I believe in building high quality products that are beautiful, functional and easy to use. As a team-player, I believe communication is key to making the creative process a success. I love to learn and I am not afraid to take on a challengeâ€“there is nothing more satisfying than a hard-won solution to a difficult problem.
